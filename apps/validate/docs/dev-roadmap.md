# Business Idea Validation Platform - Development Roadmap

## Architecture Decisions

### Repository Structure
✅ Decision: Monorepo using Nx
Rationale:
- Easier dependency management
- Shared code and type definitions
- Simplified CI/CD
- Better code reuse
- Centralized documentation

### Deployment Strategy
✅ Decision: Kubernetes Cluster with Microservices
Rationale:
- Scalable architecture
- Service isolation
- Easy horizontal scaling
- Better resource utilization
- Simple service discovery

### Technology Stack

#### Backend
- Primary: Python (FastAPI)
  - Fast development
  - Great AI/ML libraries
  - Excellent async support
  - Strong type hints
  - REST and WebSocket support

#### Frontend
- Next.js 14+
  - Server components
  - App router
  - Built-in API routes
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - Great developer experience

#### Databases
- PostgreSQL: User data, transactions, structured data
- MongoDB: Unstructured data, ideas, research data
- Redis: Caching, real-time features
- Pinecone: Vector storage for AI features
